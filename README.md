# A Hybrid SARIMAX–LSTM Framework for Spatiotemporal Tourism Forecasting

This repository contains the full implementation of “A Unified Framework for Spatiotemporal Tourism Analytics and Predictive Intelligence,” a project designed to bridge rigorous econometric modeling, deep learning, and interactive full-stack application development.

## 1. Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end computational pipeline for forecasting tourism demand in the Rías Baixas region. It combines:

- **SARIMAX–GARCH** for trend, seasonality and volatility decomposition  
- **LSTM with Bahdanau Attention** for modeling non-linear residuals  
- **Transformer** variant for benchmarking  
- **React/TypeScript + Leaflet** choropleth map demo of July 2024 accommodation density  

The entire workflow—from data ingestion to model validation and web deployment—is containerized and fully reproducible.

## 2. Motivation & Academic Context

Accurate tourism forecasts are critical for dynamic pricing, resource allocation, and strategic marketing. Purely statistical models capture linear structure but miss complex patterns; pure neural nets capture non-linearity but ignore volatility. As a double-degree student in International Business & Data Science (ESIC) and Computer Engineering (UNIR), I designed this hybrid approach to:

1. Demonstrate research initiative and methodological rigor  
2. Achieve superior forecast accuracy (≈15 % lower sMAPE vs. baseline)  
3. Showcase full-stack implementation skills, from Python modeling to interactive web apps  
4. Position myself for elite Master’s programs (ETH Zürich, EPFL) by providing a concrete, citable deliverable
